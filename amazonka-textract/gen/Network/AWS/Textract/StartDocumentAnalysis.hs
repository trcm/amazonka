-- Starts the asynchronous analysis of an input document for relationships between detected items such as key-value pairs, tables, and selection elements.
--
--
-- @StartDocumentAnalysis@ can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use 'DocumentLocation' to specify the bucket name and file name of the document.
--
-- @StartDocumentAnalysis@ returns a job identifier (@JobId@ ) that you use to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in @NotificationChannel@ . To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is @SUCCEEDED@ . If so, call 'GetDocumentAnalysis' , and pass the job identifier (@JobId@ ) from the initial call to @StartDocumentAnalysis@ .

-- | Creates a value of 'StartDocumentAnalysis' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sdaJobTag' - An identifier that you specify that's included in the completion notification published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you can use @JobTag@ to identify the type of document that the completion notification corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).
--
-- * 'sdaNotificationChannel' - The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Textract to publish the completion status of the operation to.
--
-- * 'sdaOutputConfig' - Sets if the output will go to a customer defined bucket. By default, Amazon Textract will save the results internally to be accessed by the GetDocumentAnalysis operation.
--
-- * 'sdaClientRequestToken' - The idempotent token that you use to identify the start request. If you use the same token with multiple @StartDocumentAnalysis@ requests, the same @JobId@ is returned. Use @ClientRequestToken@ to prevent the same job from being accidentally started more than once. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/api-async.html Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Operations> .
--
-- * 'sdaDocumentLocation' - The location of the document to be processed.
--
-- * 'sdaFeatureTypes' - A list of the types of analysis to perform. Add TABLES to the list to return information about the tables that are detected in the input document. Add FORMS to return detected form data. To perform both types of analysis, add TABLES and FORMS to @FeatureTypes@ . All lines and words detected in the document are included in the response (including text that isn't related to the value of @FeatureTypes@ ).
